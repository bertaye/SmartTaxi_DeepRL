# SmartTaxi_DeepRL
An implementation of Q-Learning with Open AI GYM with help of a tutorial series
In this code, we will educate a taxi agent which pick up the passenger(from a random location) and then delivers it(to a random location).

NOTE: The last section of code is for the visualization of the *learned* smart agent; which outputs too many visuals. Consider this if you will run it.

This code is written in the light of this tutorial series: https://thomassimonini.medium.com/q-learning-lets-create-an-autonomous-taxi-part-2-2-8cbafa19d7f5
